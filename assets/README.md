### This game is a five-gesture expansion of the classic selection method game rock-paper-scissors. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard (formed by the hand as a sock-puppet-like mouth) and Spock (formed by the Star Trek Vulcan salute).

### By combining timeless game  like Rock, Paper, Scissors with the modern "Bing Bang Theory" twist and classic Star Wars opening crawl with additional Stars Wars Main Theme Audio we bring nostalgia back to live, and this is where the fun beginns.

### Learn rules, play the game and have fun! This is all it takes for every user to enjoy this game.
