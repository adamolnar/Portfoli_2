            <p>5 Basic Rules !! </p>
            <br>
            <p>1. Throw rock to crush scissors or lizard. To make a rock, keep your hand in a fist as you say 3. Rock wins against scissors or lizard, but loses to paper or Spock. Rock is thst common object to throw in the game. If you want to win, avoid throwing rock the first time you play with another person.</p>
            <p>2. Use paper to cover rock or disprove Spock. Fully extend your fingers and hold them together so your palm faces down to form paper. Paper wins a game against rock and Spock, but loses to scissors and lizard.</p>
            <p>3. Play scissors to cut paper or decapitate lizard. Stick out your index and middle finger to make a pair of scissors with your hand. Scissors wins the game against paper and lizard, but loses to rock and Spock.</p>
            <p>4. Choose lizard to eat paper or poison Spock. Lizard is one of the new additions to this version of the game. Put your 4 fingers together and make a “mouth” with your thumb. Lizard wins games against paper or Spock, but loses to scissors and rock.</p>
            <p>5. Use Spock to vaporize rock or smash the scissors. Make the Vulcan salute by holding your index and middle finger together. Hold your ring finger and pinkie together, leaving a space between your middle and ring finger. Spock wins against rock or scissors, but loses to lizard and paper.</p>
