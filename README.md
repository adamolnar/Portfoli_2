### This game is a five-gesture expansion of the classic selection method game rock-paper-scissors. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard (formed by the hand as a sock-puppet-like mouth) and Spock (formed by the Star Trek Vulcan salute).
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### By combining timeless game  like Rock, Paper, Scissors with the modern "Bing Bang Theory" twist and classic Star Wars opening crawl with additional Stars Wars Main Theme Audio we bring nostalgia back to live, and this is where the fun beginns.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Learn rules, play the game and have fun! This is all it takes for every user to enjoy this game.

## Features Left to Implement
- If more time available and more experience with Java Script gained: 
  - I would add Game Over sound from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/failure-4-with-gong-69906/) or You Won sound from [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/sound-effects/success-fanfare-trumpets-6185/).

  [Explosion animation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explosion-animation-in-canvas/).
  - Confetti animation in win.html not just copied and adjusted to project needs but wriiten by myself [CodePen](https://codepen.io/programking/pen/AJgeEd).
   - Hyperjump and countdwon animation in CSS, between index.html and game.html to create space travel experience for the user [CodePen](https://codepen.io/noahblon/pen/DpNRyR).

## Bugs
### Solved Bugs
- When I deployed my project to GitHub Pages i discovered my game was broken, the link to the other files (CSS, JS, images etc.) did not work. I discovered this was beacuse I had absolute file paths such as this in my code. Removing the starting / fixed the problem.

      <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/game.css">
 
- Scissors emoji when chosen by user wasn't showing score and result message.

<!--Options available to player to play game -->
            <div class="choice-container" id="player-choice-container">
                <p class="emoji">ü™®</p>
                <p class="emoji">üìÑ</p>
                <p class="emoji">‚úÇÔ∏è</p>
                <p class="emoji">ü¶é</p>
                <p class="emoji">üññüèª</p>
            </div>


- After adding white space directly to scissors emoji in game.html, issue was solved.

<!--Options available to player to play game -->
            <div class="choice-container" id="player-choice-container">
                <p class="emoji">ü™®</p>
                <p class="emoji">üìÑ</p>
                <p class="emoji">‚úÇÔ∏è </p>
                <p class="emoji">ü¶é</p>
